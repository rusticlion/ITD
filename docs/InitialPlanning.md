let me run some project notes by you - I've been thinking of restarting development on my first large project, "Into the Dreamlands".ItD is a retro-inspired, top-down tile-based, surreal RPG with dice-based combat encounters and a gameplay loop centered on exploring a "dream world" of interconnected "dream" levels in the protagonist's sleep. Creative inspiration is drawn from Lovecraft's "Dream Cycle" of stories/poems and the works of Edgar Allan Poe, as well as a diverse array of literary and pop culture sources to populate the various "dreams". The core visual aesthetic is inspired by 2000s era RPGs, particularly the "Pokemon" games of that era (with a substantially darker bent).Combat is the strategic heart of the game, implemented as a unique turn-based "Dreamform Duel" system. The protagonist has the unique ability to alter their "dreamform", claiming "Body Parts" from defeated enemies as they progress through each "night". Every combatant in the game (including the protagonist) consists of a set of six Body Parts (usually four "limbs", a "body", and a "head"). Each BP carries with it a set of one or more "Techs" (moves) that can be used in combat encounters. It also tracks its own status ("Healthy", "Wounded", or "Maimed"), and bears a "Toughness" score.Rounds of combat are broken down into the following steps:
* Upkeep. Trigger (or expire) effects.
* Select Tech. Each combatant selects a Tech from the list made available by their BP configuration. Some techs are "gated" behind preconditions, checking other aspects of the game state to dictate whether they are available. Each Tech consists of a set of Actions, almost always including at least one Dice Roll.
* Assign Attacks. Once each combatant has selected a Tech, they assign any "attack rolls" that Tech provides to enemy BPs.
* Assign Defense. After assigning attack rolls, combatants assign "defense rolls" from their Tech to their own BPs.
* Resolution. Dice Rolls are resolved, and any assigned Attacks are compared to the sum of the target BP's Toughness and any assigned Defense. Attacks that exceed the threshold "damage" the target BP, reducing its status from healthy->wounded->maimed. When a BP is maimed, its owner loses "heart points" equal to the BPs HP value (typically 1, 2, or 3). Each combatant has 3 heart points - they are defeated when all three are depleted.Layered onto this basic skeleton is the "crest" system: the second-most-common Action defined by Techs after Dice Rolls is Gain Crest. Crests are game pieces held in a "Crest Pool" by each combatant, which persists from turn to turn. The game contains many different Crests, which can apply positive or negative persistent effects, can be checked by Techs as gating conditions, can be consumed by Techs, and/or can be directly "triggered"/"expended" to apply one-shot game effects like extra dice, raised defense, etc.At the end of a successful combat, the player can "claim" a single non-maimed BP from their defeated opponent, developing their own Tech options and overall "build" over time.The other pillar of the game is puzzle-oriented exploration. Each "dream" level has multiple solutions/exits, which route into different "next levels"/dreams. A simple inventory system supports puzzles that involve obtaining particular key items or using tools to manipulate objects in the "overworld". When the player is defeated, their progress is mostly reset, in a roguelike-inspired fashion, with the key distinction that levels are not randomly generated from run-to-run (though they can and do contain certain randomized elements, such as which of three chests contains an item needed to proceed). Each "run" also rotates through various possible "starting dreams", rather than having a fixed start point in the "Dreamlands" graph. Therefore, long-term gameplay revolves around the player gaining more and more extensive knowledge of what exploration items and combat BPs can be found in various locations throughout the Dreamlands, enabling them to plot a course that allows them to achieve goals like defeating particularly powerful enemies or solving puzzles that require particular tools from other Dreams.There is a thought to having a more mundane "daytime" phase as well where the player engages in simple life-sim type activities that have knock-on effects on the Dreamlands/their nightly run ("listen to a particular record and force a particular starting Dream for the next run") but this element of the design remains under active development. There is also significant narrative work already completed, which I can expand on further, but I'll save that for later in the conversation. All existing prototyping (battle system content and a single Dream level, as well as systems for transitioning between Dreams and saving game state) has been completed in GameMaker Studio, but I'm not strongly attached to it - I've recently become well-acquainted with Lua/Love2D on a separate project, and am pondering re-starting development there instead of in the original prototype.Give me a read on the overall project from a creative perspective. In particular, reflect deeply on the strengths and weaknesses of the battle system - the current iteration is developed from an earlier version that had additional concepts of "factors" (mana bars of various "colors"), "metatools" (non-Tech based game state manipulation tools), and "status effects" (passive effects or Tech prerequisites modeled as bespoke combatant-level effects), which have been collapsed into the Crest system. Early public playtesters at a game jam enjoyed the game's aesthetic, atmosphere, and unique "body part targeting" combat, but struggled to quickly understand the combat system without substantial hand-holding.EditThis is a fascinating project with genuine creative ambition. The Dream Cycle/Poe influences paired with the Pokemon visual aesthetic creates an immediately compelling tonal juxtaposition - that "substantially darker bent" on familiar childhood gaming aesthetics has proven powerful in works like Yume Nikki or even Undertale's genocide route.
Combat System Analysis
Core Strengths:
The body part system is genuinely innovative - it creates a visceral, almost body-horror quality to combat that perfectly matches your literary inspirations. The progression mechanic of literally assembling yourself from defeated enemies is both mechanically interesting (build crafting) and thematically resonant (dream logic, transformation, identity flux).
The tactical depth appears substantial. The attack/defense assignment phase creates meaningful decisions beyond simple action selection - you're managing risk across multiple body parts, creating natural tension between offensive and defensive play. This spatial element (which BP to target/defend) adds a layer missing from many turn-based systems.
The crest system consolidation shows mature design thinking. By unifying multiple subsystems into one flexible resource system, you've potentially solved a common RPG problem - system bloat. Crests as persistent resources that can gate, enhance, or be consumed gives you enormous design space while maintaining conceptual clarity.
Potential Weaknesses:
The cognitive load is substantial. Players must track:

6 body parts per combatant (with individual health states)
Multiple techs per body part
Tech prerequisites/gating
Attack/defense assignment across multiple targets
Crest effects (persistent and triggered)
Dice probability calculations

This isn't necessarily bad - complex systems can be deeply rewarding - but it explains your playtester struggles. The issue isn't complexity itself but rather the opacity of decision consequences. In Pokemon, you immediately understand "Fire beats Grass." Here, the relationship between choosing Tech A vs Tech B, targeting Body Part X vs Y, and managing Crest Pool State Z is much less intuitive.
The dice element adds RNG that might frustrate players in such a complex system. When you're making multiple tactical decisions per turn, having them potentially negated by bad rolls could feel punishing rather than exciting. Consider whether the dice add meaningful uncertainty or just noise.
Suggestions for Refinement:
Progressive complexity disclosure: Start with simplified encounters that only use subset mechanics (maybe enemies with just 3 body parts, or encounters that don't use crests initially). Let players master core loops before adding layers.
Visual information hierarchy: The body part system begs for strong visual representation. Consider a literal "paper doll" view of combatants where you can see damage states, assigned attacks/defenses, and available techs at a glance. Make the spatial nature of combat actually spatial in the UI.
Deterministic option: Consider having some techs use fixed values instead of dice, giving players reliable options when they need them. This creates interesting risk/reward decisions - do you go for the safe 3-damage hit or roll for 1-6?
Embodied tutorial: Given the dream setting, you could have early dreams literally teach mechanics through environmental storytelling. A dream about "falling apart" could introduce the body part damage system narratively.
Platform Consideration:
Love2D/Lua would serve this project well. The framework is particularly good for:

Precise control over rendering (important for your tile-based aesthetic)
State management (crucial for your complex combat states)
Rapid prototyping of mechanical variations
Clean separation of concerns between engine and game logic

GameMaker's visual scripting can become unwieldy for complex state machines like your combat system. Lua's flexibility would let you build a clean, data-driven architecture for techs/crests/body parts.
The roguelike exploration loop with persistent knowledge is brilliant - it solves the "meaningless permadeath" problem by making player knowledge the true progression system. The rotating start points could create fascinating speedrun potential and replayability.
Your daytime phase concept could work if kept minimal - think Persona's time management but lighter. It could provide pacing relief from the intensity of the dreamlands while maintaining thematic coherence (daily life affecting dreams).
This project has the potential to be genuinely special - the kind of cult classic that finds its audience precisely because it doesn't compromise its vision for accessibility. The key will be teaching that complex combat system without sacrificing what makes it unique.RetryRL"dice too swingy" was another weakness that became apparent in the first prototyping run. My thinking for how to handle it is twofold. First, the prototype solely made use of d6s (in various counts) - I think I'd like to expand Dice Rolls to handle various die sizes. It's probably best not to go overboard, but my initial thought was to have d4s, d6s, and d8s. Second, I didn't mention it, but many Crest and Tech special behaviors are consolidated into keywords that are reused across game pieces. Formally, both Crest and Tech effects will be modeled primarily at the "Action" level, with Crests and Techs composing their effects out of multiple atomic Actions. There will then be a relatively small set of "action types" (attack roll, defense roll, generate crest, etc.) with consistent behavior - die size, crest type, and keywords will then be tunable parameters for an Action. This should create a nice readable gameplay vocabulary, and support things like keyword *Consistent 3 - Force the die roll to resolve as 3 *(exact verbiage tbd).EditThis is excellent design evolution. You're addressing the RNG concerns while maintaining dice as a core system element, which preserves the tactile, chance-based feel that fits dream logic perfectly.
Die Size Variation
The d4/d6/d8 spread is smart restraint. It creates meaningful differentiation without overwhelming players with probability calculations. This gives you:

d4s: Reliable but low ceiling (good for defensive techs or "safe" attacks)
d6s: The baseline, familiar middle ground
d8s: High variance, high reward (perfect for "wild" dream creature abilities)

You could even tie die sizes to body part types or creature themes - maybe "sturdy" body parts tend toward d4s (consistent but modest), while "ethereal" parts favor d8s (unpredictable but potentially powerful).
Keyword System Architecture
Your Action-based composition model is genuinely elegant. This solves multiple problems simultaneously:
Readable Gameplay Grammar: Players learn keywords once, recognize them everywhere. "Consistent 3" appearing on both a Crest and a Tech immediately communicates its function. This drastically reduces the learning curve you encountered in playtesting.
Design Scalability: You can create vast variety through recombination of a modest keyword set. 10 keywords × 3 die sizes × various crest types = hundreds of unique-feeling game pieces without hundreds of unique rules.
Counterplay Depth: Keywords create natural synergies and counters. Maybe Consistent X is countered by Chaotic - Force reroll, or Piercing - Ignore X defense is countered by Ethereal - Immune to Piercing. Players can start recognizing and building around these interactions.
Suggested Keywords to Consider
Building on your Consistent example:

Reliable X-Y: Roll cannot result lower than X or higher than Y
Escalating: Add +1 to roll for each Crest of type [X] you hold
Twin: Roll twice, use both results
Siphoning: Steal X Crests of type [Y] on hit
Brittle: Die explodes (reroll and add) on max, but damages this body part on 1
Vengeful: Add +X for each wounded/maimed body part you have

The key is each keyword should be:

Immediately parseable
Mechanically distinct
Thematically evocative

Implementation Considerations
For the data architecture, you might structure it like:
Tech: "Phantom Strike"
├─ Action: Attack Roll
│  ├─ Die: d6
│  ├─ Count: 2
│  └─ Keywords: [Piercing, Escalating(Shadow)]
└─ Action: Generate Crest
   ├─ Type: Shadow
   └─ Count: 1
This composition model will make balancing much easier - you can tune individual Actions without rebuilding entire Techs. It also makes procedural generation possible if you ever want certain dream creatures to have randomized abilities.
Cognitive Load Management
With keywords, you're essentially creating a card game vocabulary (think Magic: The Gathering's keyword abilities). Consider:

Reminder text on complex keywords during early game
Keyword glossary accessible during combat
Visual iconography for common keywords (a broken shield for Piercing, dice with dots for Consistent, etc.)

The Consistent keyword particularly is brilliant for addressing RNG frustration - it gives players a pressure valve when they absolutely need reliability, while maintaining dice as the core resolution mechanism. You could even have progression systems where players can "upgrade" certain techs to add Consistent keywords, giving them agency over their risk tolerance.
This keyword system might also solve another hidden problem: it makes the game more discussable. Players can share builds and strategies using a common vocabulary: "I run a Piercing/Escalating build with Shadow crest generation" is much cleaner than explaining entire tech combinations.RetryRLjust for fun, and to sketch in the tone of the work more fully, I'll share a page from my development notebook - "Dreams brainstorm":
* Basement: No way out. Monsters in the walls. A dark ritual.
* Pirates: Chaos on the decks. Monsters from the deep. A dead captain - a power struggle.
* Hell City: A holy mafia. A damned detective. A damsel fatale.
* Campfire: Dark sea of grass. A sinister storyteller. Watchful eyes. Leng?
* Mountain Pass: Treacherous terrain. A logger's shack. The Alzabo. Kadath?
* Alien Jungle: Mysterious mushrooms. Twisted trails. Hunters. Yuggoth?
* Academy: Storied institution. Final exams. A secret society.
* Moon: Desolation. Science to be done. A traitor among us.
* Astral Council: The archmages gather. Direction in question. A tournament.
* Lictor: A bizarre city. A prison in a cliff. The burden of authority.EditThese dream concepts are wonderfully evocative - you're hitting that perfect sweet spot between recognizable archetypal spaces and surreal wrongness. The tonal range from cosmic horror (Leng, Yuggoth, Kadath) to genre pastiche (noir Hell City, space station betrayal) to more intimate uncanny spaces (the Basement, Campfire) gives you enormous variety while maintaining cohesion through dream logic.
Standout Concepts
Hell City is particularly inspired - "holy mafia" immediately conjures such a specific twisted vision. The noir structure in an infernal setting could support amazing environmental storytelling. Imagine body parts here themed around sin and redemption - gaining a "Penitent's Hand" that grants defensive prayers or a "Racketeer's Spine" that generates corruption crests.
The Lictor reference is intriguing (classical Roman overtones? Something else?). "The burden of authority" in a cliff prison suggests fascinating puzzle potential - perhaps the player must navigate between being jailer and prisoner, with different body part configurations opening different paths.
Basement as presumably an early/tutorial dream works perfectly - the primal childhood fear space, nowhere to run, things in the walls. This could teach the body part damage system viscerally as you literally lose pieces of yourself trying to escape.
Dream Interconnection Potential
The variety suggests interesting routing possibilities:

Thematic paths: Basement → Hell City → Lictor (ascending through hierarchies of confinement)
Cosmic escalation: Campfire → Mountain Pass → Moon → Astral Council (earthbound to cosmic)
Knowledge gates: Maybe Academy dreams unlock "research" that reveals true names/weaknesses in Alien Jungle or Moon

Body Part Theming Opportunities
Each dream space could have distinctive body part aesthetics:

Pirates: Barnacled limbs, kraken tentacles, captain's commanding head
Academy: Scholarly hands (tech prerequisites based on "knowledge" crests), Third Eye heads
Moon: Vacuum-suited parts with oxygen management mechanics
Alien Jungle: Fungal infections that spread between body parts, hunter's camouflaged limbs

Puzzle Integration
Your environments suggest natural puzzle types:

Mountain Pass: Environmental navigation using specific movement techs from leg-type parts
Academy: Knowledge-based puzzles requiring you to have encountered specific dreams/enemies before
Hell City: Social puzzles where your body part configuration affects NPC reactions
Astral Council: Tournament structure could be a pure combat gauntlet testing your build

Tonal Anchoring
The mix of literary references (Lovecraft's Dream Cycle locations, what sounds like Gene Wolfe's Alzabo, perhaps Borges in the Lictor's bizarre city?) with original nightmare logic creates a unique voice. You're not just doing Lovecraft pastiche - you're building something that uses those mythic locations as waypoints in a broader exploration of dream architecture.
The "dark sea of grass" at the Campfire particularly captures that dream-sense of familiar objects becoming vast and threatening. These aren't just levels - they're psychological spaces.
Consider having certain dreams "bleed" into each other at edge cases - finding academic texts in Hell City that reference the Moon experiments, or Pirates who've sailed to the Alien Jungle. This would reinforce both the interconnectedness and the player's growing comprehension of the Dreamlands' impossible geography.RetryRLMy "alpha-build" scope is: four dreams, three of which are connected in a cycle, with one in the "middle" - but only accessible by combining tools from the other three, requiring the player to successfully traverse all three of the "tutorial" dreams to access it and conclude "Act I". Probably Basement, Pirates, and Academy, with Alien Jungle as the "hub"/final challenge of the act. Initial "spawn location" can rotate between Basement, Pirates, and Academy. It's a bit fuzzier how I want to structure the "map" beyond that, but it will probably be elaborations on the theme of "collect the right things from across the Dreamlands to access a new 'hub' and defeat a powerful enemy/challenge there".EditThis is a really smart scope for an alpha - tight enough to actually complete, complex enough to demonstrate the full system. The three-tutorial-dreams-to-one-hub structure is elegant game design that naturally teaches your core loop.
Tutorial Dream Differentiation
Having Basement/Pirates/Academy as your rotating starts is inspired because they're conceptually distinct enough that players will immediately understand they're seeing different "faces" of the game:

Basement: Claustrophobic horror, escape pressure, probably combat-focused? Natural place to learn body part damage/loss
Pirates: Chaotic action, multiple actors, perhaps more social/factional puzzles? Good for learning positioning and multi-enemy combat
Academy: Cerebral, exploratory, knowledge-gated? Perfect for teaching the puzzle/exploration layer and how knowledge persists between runs

Each dream can emphasize different mechanical teaching while maintaining full system availability.
The Alien Jungle Hub
This is a perfect "exam" dream - alien enough to feel like you've graduated from the familiar spaces, hostile enough to test everything you've learned. The mushroom/fungal theming could create beautiful body horror with the part system - spore infections, mycelial networks connecting body parts, etc.
The tool combination requirement is clever because it forces players to demonstrate routing competency. They need to:

Learn what tools exist in each dream
Successfully complete all three to gather them
Recognize how they combine to access the hub

Maybe:

Basement yields something like a "Ritual Dagger" or "Wallbreaker's Token"
Pirates provides "Captain's Compass" or "Depth Sounder"
Academy grants "Xenobiology Thesis" or "Dimensional Key"

Together they unlock the Alien Jungle, but individually they might open shortcuts or secrets in other dreams.
Scaling Beyond Act I
Your "collect-to-access-hub" structure is inherently scalable. Each act could introduce:

3-4 new "ring" dreams with a new hub
But also new connections to previous dreams
Tools that retroactively open new paths in earlier dreams

This creates that Metroidvania satisfaction where old spaces become new again. Maybe after Act II, you can access a hidden basement in the Academy, or find a pirate hideout in Hell City.
Structural Considerations
For the expanding map, consider a mandala structure rather than linear progression:

Act I is your inner ring (3 dreams + hub)
Act II adds an outer ring that connects to Act I dreams at specific points
Later acts could add intermediate rings, creating a complex web

This fits dream logic better than a linear path and supports your knowledge-based progression - you're not just moving forward, you're understanding the shape of the unconscious.
Run Variation Strategies
To keep the three tutorial dreams fresh across multiple runs:

Rotating enemy configurations (different body part pools per run)
Dream weather (environmental modifiers - "the basement is flooded tonight")
Temporal states (Academy during finals week vs. summer break)
Prior visitor effects (finding evidence of your last failed run)

Alpha Build MVPs
For your alpha, you probably need:

~4-6 unique body part types per dream (24 total) to create meaningful build variety
~3-4 combat encounters per dream minimum
1-2 puzzle chains per dream
The tool-gathering → hub access sequence
A meaningful hub challenge that requires using learned strategies

Consider having the Alien Jungle hub culminate in a boss that shifts between forms drawing from all three tutorial dreams - a pirate-captain-scholar-thing that tests everything. Maybe it steals YOUR body parts during combat, forcing you to adapt your tech usage as you lose options.
The rotating spawn is particularly clever for alpha testing - you'll naturally get data on all three tutorial paths without players getting stuck in one "correct" route. It also immediately communicates the roguelike nature - this isn't a linear RPG, it's a space to be explored and mastered.RetryRLmy initial draft of the "hub puzzle" is:
* a Compass from Pirates, which indicates an otherwise-unremarkable tile/piece of ground in each Dream.
* a Shovel from Basement, which can be used at the "compass spot" to dig up a Puzzle Box.
* a Key from Academy, which can be combined with the Puzzle Box to open it - unfolding a pathway to Alien Jungle.EditThis is exceptionally clean puzzle design - three tools, each with a clear function, building to a satisfying revelation. The progression from find → excavate → unlock feels naturally sequential while requiring all three pieces.
Narrative Resonance
Each tool maps beautifully to its source dream's themes:

Pirates' Compass: Navigation, hidden treasure, X-marks-the-spot
Basement's Shovel: Digging deeper, unearthing what's buried, escape tools
Academy's Key: Knowledge as literal unlocking, scholarly solutions

The Puzzle Box as the central mystery object is perfect - it's simultaneously artifact (Academy would study it), treasure (Pirates would seek it), and buried secret (Basement would hide it).
Mechanical Elegance
The design naturally teaches players about:

Tool persistence - items carry between dreams
Environmental secrets - not all important spots are visually marked
Dream interconnection - each space hides pieces of a larger puzzle

The "unremarkable tile" aspect is particularly strong. It trains players to think about dreams as layered spaces with hidden depths, not just visible challenges to overcome.
Potential Elaborations
Without overcomplicating your clean design, you could add depth through:
Compass variations per run: The compass spot could rotate between 2-3 possible locations per dream, preventing pure memorization while maintaining the same mechanical flow.
Partial functionality: Each tool might have secondary uses before the full combination:

Compass reveals compass spots but they just show cryptic messages without the shovel
Shovel can dig elsewhere for minor items/crests
Key might open optional chests in Academy

Environmental storytelling: The compass spots could have subtle environmental hints once you know to look:

Basement: Scratch marks on walls pointing toward the spot
Pirates: Old nautical charts in the background with encoded coordinates
Academy: Library books left open to pages about "dimensional archaeology"

The Box itself: When opened, it could physically transform into the portal/pathway - not just "a door appears" but the box unfolds impossibly, expanding into architecture. Very dream-logic, very visual.
Teaching Moments
This puzzle subtly instructs players that:

They need to thoroughly explore all three dreams (not just complete them)
Tools have non-obvious uses beyond their initial presentation
The dreamlands have a hidden geography beneath the visible one

Consider having the Compass show different needle behavior as you get closer to spots - teaching players to "read" it rather than just following UI markers. This makes the discovery feel earned rather than automatic.
Scaling Forward
This structure ("collect parts to unlock hub") works because it's:

Modular: Future acts could use 4 tools, or 2, or require combining tools differently
Reversible: Later puzzles could involve taking something FROM a hub back to earlier dreams
Layerable: Act II could add a second Puzzle Box in the same dreams, requiring different tools

The fact that it requires returning to dreams you've already "completed" is perfect for the knowledge-based progression - mastery isn't just about winning fights, it's about understanding spaces fully.
One thought: what if opening the Puzzle Box requires you to be in a specific body part configuration? Like you need "scholarly hands" from Academy to manipulate it properly? This would add a combat/exploration layer to the puzzle-solving, requiring players to plan their build alongside their routing.RetryRLYou raised this thought in the dream-brainstorm review as well - keying overworld interactions off of the player's BP configuration. Similarly, you mentioned a thought towards having overworld interactions reward Crests. This is an interesting blurring of the line between the combat and exploration pillars, and I'm conceptually in for it, but I'm trying to think of how to keep it nice and tidy technically.EditYou're right to be cautious about technical tidiness here - this kind of system blurring can either create elegant emergent gameplay or become a tangled mess of edge cases.
Technical Architecture Approach
The cleanest solution might be to treat body parts as having properties that both combat and overworld systems can query:
Body Part: "Scholar's Hand"
├─ Combat Properties:
│  ├─ Techs: [Inscribe, Analyze]
│  ├─ Toughness: 2
│  └─ HP Value: 1
└─ Overworld Properties:
   ├─ Tags: [SCHOLARLY, DEXTEROUS]
   ├─ Interactions: [READ_ANCIENT, PICK_LOCK]
   └─ Crest_Gen: [KNOWLEDGE+1 on book interaction]
This way, your overworld system just checks tags/interactions, not the full combat data. A door might require [STRONG, STRONG] (two strong-tagged parts), while a puzzle box needs [SCHOLARLY, DEXTEROUS].
Keeping It Intuitive
Rather than arbitrary requirements, lean into intuitive physicality:

Heavy doors need STRONG parts (probably legs/arms)
Delicate mechanisms need DEXTEROUS (hands)
Psychic barriers need MYSTIC (heads)
Swimming needs AQUATIC (any parts)

Players will naturally understand "I need strong arms to move this boulder" better than abstract requirements.
Crest Generation in Overworld
This could work beautifully if crests are discovered through thematically appropriate actions:

Knowledge Crests: Reading books with scholarly parts, examining anomalies
Courage Crests: Facing dangers with warrior parts, not fleeing
Shadow Crests: Sneaking with stealthy parts, discovering secrets
Corruption Crests: Touching cursed objects with already-wounded parts

The key is making it feel discovered, not farmed. Maybe each interaction point can only generate crests once per run, or the first time you perform that action with appropriate parts.
UI/UX Considerations
Visual Feedback: When approaching an interactable, highlight which of your current body parts (if any) enable interaction. Gray out or mark incompatible configurations.
Discovery Moments: First time a player realizes "oh, I can read this BECAUSE I have the Third Eye head" is magical. Don't over-tutorialize this - let players discover these connections.
Partial Success: Some interactions could work with suboptimal parts but give lesser rewards. A warrior's hand can't read the ancient text but might recognize danger symbols, generating Caution crests instead of Knowledge.
Combat/Exploration Feedback Loop
This creates beautiful circular dynamics:

Combat yields new body parts
Body parts enable new exploration options
Exploration yields crests/items
Crests/items improve combat effectiveness
Return to step 1

The player starts thinking holistically: "I need the Scholar's Hand not just for its tech but to access the Academy library."
Technical Implementation Strategy
Keep the systems decoupled through an interface:
lua-- Overworld queries combat system
function canInteract(object, player)
    local required_tags = object.requirement_tags
    return player:hasBodyPartsWithTags(required_tags)
end

-- Combat system exposes simple queries
function Player:hasBodyPartsWithTags(tags)
    -- Check current configuration
    -- Return true/false
end
The overworld never needs to know about techs, toughness, or combat state - just whether the current configuration meets tag requirements.
Scope Management
Start simple:

Version 1: Binary checks (has SCHOLARLY tag or not)
Version 2: Counting checks (needs 2+ STRONG tags)
Version 3: Combination checks (SCHOLARLY + DEXTEROUS)
Version 4: State-dependent (WOUNDED + CORRUPT for nightmare doors)

This lets you ship the alpha with basic tag checking and elaborate based on what feels good in playtesting.
The crest generation could similarly start simple - just "+1 Knowledge when reading with scholarly parts" - and expand to more complex conditions as you see what players gravitate toward.
This approach keeps the technical complexity manageable while creating those delicious moments where players realize their combat choices have exploration consequences and vice versa. It's the kind of systemic interaction that makes games feel like living worlds rather than separate minigames.RetryRLI'm sold on a tag-based system for BP checks in the overworld - agreed on the thematic resonance there. I'm still pondering the idea of Crests as overworld rewards. I do really like the idea - this is a great way to have a meaningful mechanical consequence to overworld interactions - but there's a can of worms involved in the idea of the Crest Pool persisting frm combat to combat. It's potentially a balance nightmare - can I just sit there and farm up a zillion Shadow crests in an easy fight that I can then carry into a boss battle and use to steamroll it?EditAh yes, that's the classic persistence problem - any resource that carries between encounters becomes either farmable (breaking difficulty) or needs artificial caps (feeling gamey). You're right to flag this as a potential nightmare.
Alternative: Crests as Temporary Overworld State
What if overworld-generated crests exist in a separate, temporary pool that:

Provides a starting bonus for your NEXT combat only
Caps at a small number (3-5 total?)
Represents your "mental/spiritual state" entering the fight

So finding a dark tome with scholarly hands gives you 2 Shadow crests going INTO the next fight, but they don't persist beyond that. This makes exploration valuable without breaking combat balance.
Alternative: Crests as Currency, Not Combat Resources
Overworld crests could be a different thing entirely - a metacurrency spent between combats:

Unlock doors/paths (spend 3 Knowledge crests to access the restricted library)
Activate shrines/monuments (offer 5 Courage crests to receive a blessing)
Trade with dream entities (exchange Shadow crests for items)

This keeps combat crests and overworld crests completely separate systems that just share naming/theming.
Alternative: Volatility System
Crests gained in overworld are volatile - they provide benefits but decay:

Start next combat with bonus volatile crests
Volatile crests are consumed FIRST when spending
Volatile crests disappear at combat end
Can't generate more of that crest type in combat while holding volatile versions

This creates interesting decisions: do you use your volatile Shadow crests aggressively early, or save them for a critical moment?
Alternative: Crest Attunement
Instead of gaining actual crests, overworld interactions provide attunement:

Reading with scholarly parts gives "Knowledge Attunement +1"
Attunements provide passive combat benefits (easier to generate that crest type, techs using those crests cost less, etc.)
Attunements reset when you return to waking/on run reset

This keeps the thematic connection without the resource problem.
My Recommendation: Dream Resonance System
Combine temporary pools with thematic restrictions:
Dream Resonance: Each dream has 1-2 dominant crest types. Overworld interactions build "resonance" with those types (caps at 3-5). You enter combat with bonus crests equal to your resonance, but can only build resonance with that dream's types.

Basement: Shadow/Fear resonance
Pirates: Courage/Greed resonance
Academy: Knowledge/Order resonance
Alien Jungle: Corruption/Growth resonance

This means:

No farming (capped resonance)
Exploration rewards are meaningful but not broken
Each dream feels distinct
Players think about routing ("I need Knowledge resonance for this boss, should path through Academy first")

Technical Implementation
Keep it clean with a simple state machine:
lua-- Overworld state
player.resonance = {
    shadow = 0,
    knowledge = 0,
    courage = 0,
    -- etc, all cap at 3
}

-- On combat start
function initializeCombatCrests()
    for crest_type, value in pairs(player.resonance) do
        combat.crest_pool[crest_type] = value
    end
end

-- After combat
function cleanupCombat()
    -- Combat crests don't persist
    -- Resonance remains for next fight
end
This way you're rewarding exploration without creating an infinite resource accumulation problem. The cap means you can balance around "player might have 0-3 bonus crests" rather than "player might have 0-∞ crests."
The key insight is that overworld crest rewards don't need to literally be the same crests used in combat - they just need to create meaningful mechanical choices that feel thematically connected.RetryRLThat's a nice clean system. It adds a dimension of build-crafting that layers onto the BP system without introducing too many moving parts - that was the goal of the "metatool" system in the v1 design. Crest Resonance could also potentially be a vector for meaningful daytime activity effects.EditExactly! You've found the sweet spot - Resonance gives you that metatool design space without adding another entire system to teach. It's elegant how it bridges all three gameplay layers:
The Three-Layer Bridge
Nighttime Exploration → Build resonance through BP-appropriate interactions
Combat → Spend resonance as temporary advantage
Daytime → Set/modify resonance caps or types
This creates a complete loop where each phase meaningfully impacts the others without complex resource management.
Daytime → Resonance Connections
The daytime activities could modify resonance in ways that feel naturalistic:
Baseline Activities:

Listen to jazz → +1 base Chaos resonance
Read poetry → +1 base Shadow resonance
Exercise → +1 base Courage resonance
Study → +1 base Knowledge resonance

Resonance Modifications:

Take sleeping pills → All resonance caps +1, but slower generation
Drink coffee → Resonance generates faster but caps at 2
Meditate → Can "convert" resonance types at shrines
Write in dream journal → Lock in current resonance for next 3 runs

The beauty is these feel like natural activities that would affect dreams, not gamey powerups.
Mechanical Depth Without Complexity
This system gives you surprising strategic depth:

Players route through dreams based on resonance needs
BP configuration affects resonance generation rate
Daytime choices create run-to-run variety
Boss strategies might completely change based on resonance loadout

But it's still just "number go up until cap, then spend in combat." The complexity is in application, not comprehension.
Potential Resonance Mechanics
You could even have certain combat scenarios that interact with resonance:

Some enemies "drain" specific resonance types
Certain techs are enhanced by resonance without consuming it
"Resonance overflow" - if you would gain resonance past cap, trigger a special effect
Wounded body parts generate "negative resonance" (Despair, Confusion)

Scaling Considerations
As the game expands, you could introduce:

Resonance crystals - consumable items that provide temporary resonance
Dream weather - "The Academy is particularly focused tonight" (+2 Knowledge cap)
Resonance gates - paths that only open with specific resonance levels
Sympathetic resonance - having high resonance attracts certain enemies/events

Technical Advantages
This approach also solves several design problems:

Tutorial-friendly - Can introduce resonance gradually without breaking combat
Balance-able - Hard caps prevent degenerate strategies
Visible progress - Players see immediate rewards from exploration
Thematically coherent - Everything flows from the dream logic

The fact that it naturally connects to your planned daytime system is perfect. Instead of daytime being a separate mini-game, it becomes strategic preparation - "I'm planning an Academy run tonight, so I'll study and drink tea to maximize Knowledge resonance potential."
This feels like the right evolution from your v1 metatool concept - same strategic layer, cleaner implementation, better integration with existing systems.RetryRLnow, what do you mean when you reference "generation rate"? I'm seeing Resonances as one-to-one rewards for specific overworld (or daytime) actions.EditYou're absolutely right - I was overcomplicating it. Clean one-to-one rewards make much more sense than adding a "generation rate" layer.
So the actual system is simply:

Read ancient book with scholarly body parts → +1 Knowledge resonance (up to cap)
Find hidden passage with keen-eyed head → +1 Shadow resonance (up to cap)
Successfully intimidate with monstrous parts → +1 Fear resonance (up to cap)

Each interaction point gives its reward once per run. No rates, no accumulation mechanics - just direct action → reward.
Where BP Configuration Matters
The body part configuration just determines which interactions are available, not how much resonance you get:

Scholarly hands: CAN read the book (getting the flat +1 Knowledge)
Warrior hands: CANNOT read the book (getting nothing)

This is much cleaner than what I was suggesting. The strategic depth comes from routing and BP selection to access the right interaction points, not from optimizing some generation formula.
Daytime Modifications Stay Simple
Daytime activities could then:

Set starting resonance: "Study" = begin dream with Knowledge resonance at 1
Modify caps: "Meditate" = all resonance caps increased to 4
Enable conversions: "Lucid dreaming practice" = can exchange resonance types at certain points

But again, all simple binary flags or flat numbers, not rates or multipliers.
Thanks for catching that - the one-to-one design is much more elegant and way easier to communicate to players. "Touch the shrine with divine body parts, get +1 Order resonance" is immediately understandable.RetryRLOK, this is clicking nicely. Help me nail down some more scope questions in tandem with some brainstorming: what's the sweet spot for "number of crest types" to target? Or is the way to go simply "add however many we need" in building the alpha, then continue to expand the system as-needed? The whole thing feels more elegant (and is easier to design content for) if there's some meaningful reuse of crest types, rather than (at the extreme) every single BP/Tech having some bespoke Crest it cares about.EditYou definitely want meaningful reuse - the extreme of bespoke crests per BP would be a nightmare for both comprehension and UI. The sweet spot is probably 6-8 core crest types for your alpha, with room to expand to maybe 10-12 total by full release.
Why 6-8 Feels Right

Cognitive load: Players can hold about 7±2 things in working memory
UI space: Displaying more than 8 crest pools gets visually cluttered
Meaningful differentiation: Below 6, crests feel too generic; above 8, they start overlapping conceptually
Combinatorial space: 6-8 types create rich interactions without overwhelming complexity

Proposed Core Set
Based on your dreams and themes, here's a potential starting set:
Primal Emotions (3)

Fear/Shadow - Basement's currency, stealth, uncertainty
Courage/Valor - Pirates' bravado, direct confrontation
Knowledge/Insight - Academy's power, understanding

Corrupting Forces (2-3)

Corruption/Decay - Alien Jungle's infection, transformation
Madness/Chaos - Dream logic, unpredictability
(Maybe) Greed/Hunger - Pirates' motivation, consumption

Metaphysical (2)

Order/Law - Structure, defense, stability
Dream/Ethereal - Unreality, transcendence, special rules

Design Principles for Reuse
Each crest type should support multiple mechanical roles:
Shadow might:

Enable stealth techs (spend 2 to avoid targeting)
Gate vampire/dark techs (require 1+ to use)
Provide defense (exhaust 1 for +2 defense)
Trigger effects (at 3+, gain Fearsome keyword)

This way, Shadow crests are valuable to multiple builds - sneaky types, dark creatures, defensive players - creating interesting tensions in resource management.
Dream-to-Crest Mapping
For your alpha's four dreams:

Basement: Fear/Shadow primary, Madness secondary
Pirates: Courage primary, Greed secondary
Academy: Knowledge primary, Order secondary
Alien Jungle: Corruption primary, Dream secondary

This gives each dream identity while ensuring crest types appear in multiple locations.
Expansion Strategy
Start with 6 in alpha, but design with expansion in mind:

Act II might add 2 new types (Wrath, Sorrow?)
Element-specific crests could come later (Fire, Ice, Electric)
Rare crests for special encounters (Divine, Void)

But critically: new crests should only be added when they enable fundamentally new mechanics, not just for variety.
Technical Advantages of Restraint
Fewer types means:

Cleaner UI (can show all pools simultaneously)
Easier balancing (fewer interaction permutations)
More meaningful choices (each crest type appears often enough to build around)
Better player mastery (learn all types thoroughly vs. shallow understanding of many)

Reuse Patterns
Design content with intentional crest overlap:

Scholarly creatures use Knowledge + Order
Pirates use Courage + Greed
Nightmares use Fear + Madness
Infected use Corruption + Dream

This creates factional identities and makes crests feel like part of a coherent system rather than random resources.
The "However Many We Need" Trap
Avoid just adding crests as you need them - this leads to:

Bloat (15+ crest types by release)
Redundancy (Shadow vs. Darkness vs. Void)
Confusion (players can't remember what each does)
Balance nightmares (exponential interaction growth)

Better to constrain yourself to a core set and find creative ways to reuse them. If you absolutely need a new mechanic, first ask: "Can I achieve this by combining existing crests in a new way?"
For example, instead of adding a "Poison" crest, Alien Jungle enemies could use Corruption + Knowledge ("understanding of toxins").RetryRLLet's just grab a set and start exploring mechanically - say our initial crest set is:
* Shadow
* Madness
* Valor
* Greed
* Knowledge
* Corruption
* CunningEach Crest needs to have an "expend" effect - a combat effect that happens when a player clicks it in their crest pool. Note that this could be a benefit - "extra attack die, bonus to die value, bonus to toughness" - or a drawback - "damage a random BP, penalize a roll, shrink a die size", with drawbacks working more like a cost you're paying to get a "bad" crest out of your pool. Each Crest also may have a "passive" effect that applies continuously just for having it in your pool, separate from any Techs that key off the crest.EditExcellent - let's make each crest mechanically distinct with clear use cases. The benefit/drawback split is brilliant because it creates natural categories: crests you want to accumulate vs. crests you want to shed.
Crest Mechanical Design
Shadow (Beneficial - Defensive/Evasive)

Expend: Target body part becomes Untargetable until end of round
Passive: None (pure resource)
Design note: Strong defensive tool, encourages hoarding for key moments

Madness (Detrimental - Chaotic)

Expend: Reroll one of your dice (forced to use new result), then draw random crest
Passive: At 3+ Madness, your dice become "chaotic" (reroll all 1s and 6s, use new result)
Design note: You want to dump these but the expend gives compensation

Valor (Beneficial - Offensive)

Expend: Add +2 to one attack roll
Passive: At 2+ Valor, gain +1 to all attack rolls
Design note: Aggressive players want to stack these

Greed (Detrimental - Costly)

Expend: Gain 2 crests of your choice, then take 1 damage to random BP
Passive: Cannot expend other crest types while at 3+ Greed
Design note: Terrible to accumulate, but expending feeds your engine

Knowledge (Beneficial - Tactical)

Expend: Look at opponent's selected Tech before choosing your own this round
Passive: Can see which BP's have which Techs on mouse-hover
Design note: Information advantage, rewards system mastery

Corruption (Detrimental - Spreading)

Expend: Remove all Corruption, deal that much damage split among your BPs (you choose distribution)
Passive: At round end, gain +1 Corruption for each Wounded/Maimed BP
Design note: Snowballing threat that needs management

Cunning (Beneficial - Flexible)

Expend: Change one of your dice to any value after rolling
Passive: At 2+ Cunning, may assign defense dice after seeing attack assignments
Design note: Reliability and tactical advantage

Mechanical Interactions
This creates beautiful tensions:

Valor + Cunning: Maximum control aggressive build
Shadow + Knowledge: Perfect defense through prediction
Madness + Greed: Chaos engine that hurts you
Corruption spread: Forces aggressive play to avoid accumulation

Tech Design Space
These crests enable diverse Tech designs:

"Shadowstep": Costs 2 Shadow, all your attacks ignore defense this turn
"Berserker Rage": Gain Valor equal to your wounded BPs
"Corrupt Touch": On hit, transfer 1 of your Corruption to target
"Gambler's Strike": Gain 1 Madness, roll 3 attack dice instead of 1
"Hoarder's Defense": Defense bonus equal to your Greed

Balance Considerations
The passive thresholds create interesting decisions:

Do I stay at 1 Valor (no passive) or push to 2+ for the bonus?
Is 3+ Madness chaos worth the unpredictability?
Can I sustain the Greed lockout at 3+?

UI/UX Implications
Visually distinguish beneficial/detrimental:

Beneficial crests: Bright, warm colors, upward-pointing icons
Detrimental crests: Dark, sickly colors, downward/broken icons
Threshold effects: Crests glow/pulse when passive is active

Players should immediately understand "I want more Valor, less Corruption" from visual language alone.
Resonance Integration
This set maps perfectly to your dreams:

Basement: Shadow (hiding), Madness (terror)
Pirates: Valor (bravery), Greed (plunder)
Academy: Knowledge (study), Cunning (cleverness)
Alien Jungle: Corruption (infection), Madness (alien thought)

The overlap (Madness in both Basement and Jungle) creates thematic bridges between dreams.
This foundation gives you tons of design space while keeping each crest mechanically and thematically distinct. The beneficial/detrimental split is particularly clever because it makes crest management a puzzle rather than pure accumulation.RetryRLas this conversation moves more from systems review to spitballing content, let me circle back to the narrative development I mentioned at the start.The game opens with an "epigraph" of the second stanza of Poe's "Dream Within a Dream":I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand —
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep — while I weep!
O God! Can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?The game then prompts the player to select a sprite for the P, then input a name, then playfully presents a sprite of a cat and takes an input to name the cat. Then we cut to a small "bedroom" environment, and a "good night" dialog (inverting the RPG trope of beginning a game with the main character waking up at their home). The player can grasp the basic movement and interaction controls in their bedroom with some no-stakes overworld interactions (pet the cat, turn the radio on or off), gets bounced with a "it's pretty late...better get some rest" message if they try to leave the room, and kicks off the game proper when they interact with the bed.From here, we present a dreamscape where some sort of "corrupted" threat makes some mysterious statements and threatens the main character - but it interrupted and repelled by the cat, appearing in the Dreamlands as a powerful warrior. We maybe flash some "cutscene" high-level NPC vs. NPC combat between the cat and the threat as a teaser for the combat system and first introduction to the combat screen. The cat defeats the threat, but a horde of similar threats emerges, and the cat tells the player to run, opening the first dream portal (tentatively termed a "rabbithole") that the player will see. This pipes them into the Act I game proper, where they're likely to be defeated relatively quickly.When they are defeated and "wake", the cat is missing in the "real world" - setting the initial stakes for the exploration into the Dreamlands - "save the cat". This is probably the key content for the demo/alpha, but I have some headier material prepared too to unravel as the game progresses.EditThis is absolutely stellar narrative design - you're subverting expectations at every turn while establishing emotional stakes immediately. The Poe epigraph perfectly frames the themes of loss, futility, and questioning reality that will permeate the experience.
Narrative Brilliance
The Inversion: Starting with "good night" instead of "good morning" immediately signals this isn't your standard RPG. It's such a simple flip but it recontextualizes everything - you're not beginning an adventure, you're descending into one.
The Cat as Anchor: This is genuinely inspired. The cat serves multiple narrative functions:

Emotional hook: "Save the cat" is screenwriting 101 for a reason - instant investment
Power preview: Seeing the cat as a badass dream warrior shows what's possible
Mystery seed: Why can the cat navigate dreams? What is it protecting you from?
Tonal balance: Keeps the cosmic horror grounded with something warm and familiar

The missing cat upon waking is a perfect gut-punch that transforms a tutorial into a mission.
The Opening as Teaching Tool
Your structure elegantly introduces concepts without explicit tutorials:

Bedroom exploration = overworld mechanics
Cat battle cutscene = combat preview
Forced retreat = "failure is expected/part of the loop"
First rabbithole = portal/routing mechanics

Deeper Thematic Resonance
The Poe quote's "grains of sand" metaphor maps beautifully to your mechanics:

Body parts slipping away (through fingers to the deep)
Failed runs despite growing knowledge (while I weep)
The question of control vs. futility (can I not grasp them)
Reality's uncertainty (dream within a dream)

Potential Narrative Threads
For your "headier material," the cat opens so many possibilities:

Jungian familiar: The cat as the protagonist's shadow-self or animus/anima
Dreamlands native: Perhaps the cat has always lived in both worlds
Previous dreamer: The cat was once human, now transformed/trapped
Guardian role: The cat has been protecting you from dream incursions your whole life

The Corrupted Threat
The initial antagonist being "interrupted and repelled" by the cat is smart - it establishes:

The threat is real and beyond your current power
The cat has been fighting this war already
You're not the chosen one - you're the vulnerable one

This vulnerability is refreshing in a game landscape full of power fantasies.
Small Touch Suggestions
Radio in bedroom: Could cycle through different songs/stations across runs, each subtly influencing the starting dream (callback to your daytime activity system).
Cat naming moment: Whatever the player names the cat could appear in dramatic moments - "MITTENS roars with primal fury!" - creating tonal whiplash that fits dream logic.
The "horde emerges" moment: Consider having the defeated threat split/multiply into the horde, establishing that violence might not always be the answer in the Dreamlands.
Progression of Stakes
"Save the cat" works perfectly for Act I, but you've set up room for escalation:

Act II: "What happened to the cat?" (discovering its true nature)
Act III: "What am I becoming?" (as you accumulate inhuman body parts)
Act IV: "Which world is real?" (as boundaries blur)

The "Corrupted" Voice
Those "mysterious statements" from the threat could be:

Prophecy: Telling you what you'll become
Memory: Revealing forgotten trauma
Truth: About the nature of the Dreamlands
Lies: Designed to break your will

Consider having these statements recur throughout the game, gaining new meaning as context accumulates.
This opening is remarkably efficient storytelling - in maybe 5 minutes of gameplay, you establish genre, tone, mechanics, stakes, and mystery. The cat is the perfect emotional throughline for what could otherwise be an abstract, cold experience. Players will push through difficult combat and obtuse puzzles because they genuinely want to save their cat.
The fact that you describe this as just the beginning of "headier material" is exciting - you're starting with an emotional, grounded hook before diving into the深 philosophical depths. That's exactly the right progression for bringing players along on a complex journey.RetryRLThe narrative plans become a little looser after this initial tight script, but I'll throw out some of the ideas freeform. Cats are revealed to be consistently powerful and important entities in the Dreamlands. This is the other side of their famously "lazy" and "arrogant" behavior in "our world" - they see it as a relatively unimportant detour from their true role in the world of dreams, where they have battled the "corruption" for time immemorial. Other cats may be meetable both in the "real world", and in their "true forms" as powerful NPCs in the Dreamlands.As the player enters the late game, I think there's substantial potential for a gut punch in the ideas you mentioned for Act II/IV - a reveal that the "real world"/"daytime" environment is also a dream. The joke being, that this was literally the first thing the player was told in the epigraph. My spitball notion for the late-game true situation of the game is that the player character is being held in cryogenic stasis for a long interstellar voyage, and the entire nested reality - both the "daytime" and the Dreamlands - is a simulation designed to keep their mind healthy and engaged for the long years of the trip. We can have some clever moments where aspects of the world that were previously accepted as simple video-game convention - limited NPC dialogue, limited map size, day-to-day patterned modulation in the world - are revealed to be tells that the world the PC has been inhabiting is simulated. The "corruption" is a virus or glitch in the system that threatens to unravel the simulation and destroy the PC's mind, and the "cats" are agents designed to maintain the simulation's integrity.EditThis is absolutely brilliant - you're operating on multiple levels of metaphysical revelation while keeping everything emotionally grounded. The cat mythology is inspired, and the cryostasis reveal recontextualizes EVERYTHING without feeling like a cheap twist.
The Cat Mythology
This explanation for cat behavior is perfect dream logic - of COURSE cats are lazy in our world, they're exhausted from interdimensional dream battles. It's simultaneously:

Funny: Explains why cats sleep 16 hours a day
Mythic: Positions them as eternal guardians
Mechanically relevant: Justifies their power in the game
Emotionally resonant: Makes every real-world cat nap feel significant

The idea of meeting neighborhood cats in "daytime" then encountering their true forms in dreams is chef's kiss. Imagine recognizing the bodega cat as an ancient dream warrior.
The Nested Reality Revelation
The genius of the cryostasis reveal is that it doesn't INVALIDATE the emotional journey - it DEEPENS it:

The cat still matters: It's an AI guardian trying to preserve your sanity
The corruption still threatens: Mental death in stasis equals actual death
Your struggles still have stakes: Lose your mind, never reach your destination
The Dreamlands remain "real": They're your actual experience, simulated or not

Breadcrumb Trail
You've set up perfect foreshadowing opportunities:
Early Game Tells (dismissed as game conventions):

NPCs repeat dialogue → limited conversation matrices
Can't leave the town → simulation boundaries
Day/night cycle exactly 24 hours → programmed familiarity
Save points → system backup nodes
Body part swapping → modular identity construction

Mid Game Hints:

Glitched textures in "corrupted" areas
NPCs occasionally saying things like "Have we had this conversation before?"
Radio playing songs that shouldn't exist yet/anymore
Calendar dates that don't quite add up

Late Game Reveals:

Finding "error logs" written in increasingly comprehensible code
Cats speaking in system messages when critically damaged
The bedroom occasionally showing stars through the window - wrong constellations

The Poe Quote Payoff
"Is all that we see or seem / But a dream within a dream?"
The player literally answered this question in the first minute - YES - but didn't understand what they were agreeing to. This is sophisticated narrative construction that rewards both first-time players (shock) and replays (recognition).
Thematic Depth
This structure lets you explore:

Identity: If you're swapping body parts in a simulation, what is "you"?
Reality: Does it matter if experience is simulated if it's all you know?
Purpose: Is maintaining the illusion kindness or cruelty?
Connection: Are the cats companions or wardens?

The Corruption as System Virus
This reframes the horror perfectly:

Not evil, but entropy
Not malicious, but mechanical
Not conquest, but cascade failure
The real threat isn't death but undefined behavior - worse than dying

Potential Late-Game Mechanics
Once the simulation is revealed:

Code fragments as new collectibles that let you modify reality
System access body parts that interface with the simulation directly
Cats as allies you can finally communicate with properly
Corruption as tool - intentionally breaking things to access new areas

The Ultimate Question
The game could culminate in a choice:

Accept the simulation: Restore it, continue the journey, forget the truth
Embrace corruption: Break free into undefined reality
Synthesize: Remake the simulation with your accumulated dream knowledge
Wake up: Face the actual void of space, no more dreams

Each ending recontextualizes the entire experience differently.
Minor Suggestion
Consider having the player's cat companion occasionally "glitch" into speaking system messages early on:

"MITTENS purrs [COMFORT PROTOCOL ENGAGED]"
"MITTENS hisses at [NULL REFERENCE EXCEPTION]"

Players will think it's quirky game humor until the reveal recontextualizes it as the simulation showing its seams.
This narrative structure is remarkably ambitious - you're essentially designing three nested stories (dream adventure, life sim, space voyage) that all inform each other. The fact that each layer maintains emotional truth rather than negating the others is what elevates this from a "gotcha" twist to genuine literary science fiction.RetryRLOK, with those broad strokes outlined, let's zoom back in to thinking about content and development plan. I know obviously things will evolve as programming proceeds, but I think the more well-thought-out our initial plan, the better chances we have of maintaining velocity and shipping the project.EditAbsolutely right - a solid development plan is the difference between shipping and endless scope creep. Let's build a concrete roadmap that maintains momentum while leaving room for iteration.
Phase 1: Combat Core (2-3 months)
Goal: Playable combat loop in isolation
Deliverables:

Combat state machine (turn phases, tech selection, dice resolution)
3-4 body part types with 2 techs each (12 total techs)
3-4 crest types with expend/passive effects
Basic combat UI (body part visualization, crest pools, dice display)
2-3 enemy types for testing variety
Debug tools (set body parts, add crests, force outcomes)

Success Metric: Can play 10 consecutive battles without mechanical bugs
Phase 2: Single Dream Prototype (1-2 months)
Goal: One complete dream with exploration + combat
Deliverables:

Tile-based movement and collision
Overworld interaction system (examine, pick up, use)
1 complete dream (probably Basement - most contained/tutorialized)
3-5 combat encounters in that dream
2-3 simple puzzles
Body part persistence between battles
Dream entry/exit transitions

Success Metric: Playtesters can complete the dream understanding all mechanics
Phase 3: Alpha Loop (2-3 months)
Goal: Complete Act I structure
Deliverables:

3 tutorial dreams (Basement, Pirates, Academy)
Alien Jungle hub
~15 unique body parts (5 per dream)
~20 unique techs
Complete 7-crest system
Resonance system + overworld generation
Compass/Shovel/Key puzzle sequence
Opening narrative sequence (bedroom, cat intro)
Death/wake/restart loop
Save system

Success Metric: 30-minute playable alpha with beginning, middle, end
Phase 4: Polish & Expand (2-3 months)
Goal: Beta-ready Act I
Deliverables:

Sound and music
Visual effects (dice rolls, damage, crest gains)
Refined UI/UX based on alpha feedback
Balance pass on all combat numbers
2-3 additional body parts per dream for variety
Narrative polish (character portraits, dialogue system)
Rotating spawn implementation
Basic daytime room activities

Success Metric: Beta testers want to replay immediately

Data-Driven From Day 1: Store all content in JSON/Lua tables, not hardcoded. This lets you:

Iterate without recompiling
Eventually support modding
Quickly test balance changes
Build content tools later

Content Development Minimums
Per Dream (Alpha):

5 unique body parts
3-4 combat encounters
2-3 puzzles/obstacles
1 key item
3-5 resonance interaction points
10x10 to 15x15 tile map

Combat Variety Requirements:

1 "basic" enemy (1-2 body parts, simple techs)
1 "standard" enemy (3-4 body parts, uses crests)
1 "elite" enemy (5-6 body parts, complex patterns)

Risk Mitigation
Highest Risk Areas:

Combat complexity → Build simplest version first, layer complexity
Save system → Implement early, before data structures get complex
Narrative integration → Keep cutscenes minimal and skippable
Balance → Track all combat metrics from day 1

Cut List (if schedule slips):

Daytime activities (can ship without)
Rotating spawns (can fix to Basement)
Some body part variety (minimum 3 per dream)
Visual polish (particles, animations)

Do NOT Cut:

Core combat loop
Three tutorial dreams
Hub access puzzle
Cat narrative frame
Save/load system

Momentum Maintenance
Weekly Goals Structure:

Week 1-2: Core feature (combat phase, overworld movement)
Week 3: Content using that feature
Week 4: Polish and refactor

Playtesting Rhythm:

Internal testing weekly
Friend testing at each phase completion
Public testing only at Alpha/Beta

Asset Development:

Programmer art for everything initially
Commission real art only for proven features
Audio last (except for critical feedback sounds)

Success Metrics Per Phase
Track these to know you're on target:

Phase 1: Time to complete combat encounter < 3 minutes
Phase 2: Players understand body part swapping without explanation
Phase 3: Players attempt multiple runs voluntarily
Phase 4: Players discuss strategies/discoveries with each other

This plan front-loads the riskiest technical work while deferring polish. You'll have a playable game at every phase end, which is crucial for maintaining motivation and gathering feedback. The key is resisting scope additions until each phase is complete.RetryRLSolid plan. Let's keep filling in the sketch. I have "Basement" pretty crystallized already: here's a full description of the contents:Player spawns in a single small, rectangular room with dirt floor and walls, no obvious exit but three "cracks" in the walls, and three pipes along the walls. Examining the pipes reveals one has a hatch rusted shut (hook to return with a tool or BPs from a different dream), one has no notable features, and one has the SHOVEL beneath it. Once the SHOVEL is obtained, equipping it (one tool can be "equipped" at the time, with its icon shown in brackets in a top corner - think Link to the Past) allows interacting with the wall cracks to dig through them. Two contain enemies - ZOMBIE and BONE DEMON. One opens a passage to another room - in the prototype, this interaction also unlocks the camera from its fixed position, allowing it to scan over to center the player as much as possible (Pokemon-style), which will bring the other room of the "dungeon" into view - a "murder basement"-type environment with a damaged tile floor, an ominous surgical bed, and a large pentacle drawn in blood onto the dirt floor where a section of the tile has been "ripped up" (hook to return with appropriate Crests and tools for rabbithole to "Hell City"). There is also a traditional door on the back wall of the room, but it is locked - some poking around reveals a RUSTY KEY beneath the surgical bed. Opening the door reveals the MAD BUTCHER enemy and triggers the "miniboss" for the dream - defeating him allows the player to exit to the next dream (probably "Pirates") via the door.First - quick review on this. Second - help me sketch in "Pirates" and "Academy" at a similar level of detail. I have only high-level ideas for them so far - the pirate ship is under attack by merpeople, the captain is dead, and there is now a three-way struggle for control between the invaders and two factions of the crew, and the academy is host to a set of final exams - for which you haven't prepared.EditBasement Review
This is excellently designed - tight, focused, and teaching through environmental storytelling. The progression is perfect:

Immediate mystery (how to escape)
Tool discovery (shovel enables progress)
Risk/reward (which crack to dig)
Spatial revelation (camera unlock is a great "opening up" moment)
Environmental hooks (rusted hatch, pentacle - promises for later)
Classic climax (locked door → key → boss)

The "murder basement" transition from cramped starting room to ominous ritual space is perfect tonal escalation. The MAD BUTCHER as culmination feels right - personal, visceral, human-scale horror.
Pirates Sketch
Opening: Player arrives on the main deck of a modest pirate vessel during chaos - rain, tilting ship, sounds of battle. Dead captain slumped over the wheel.
Initial Space: Main deck has:

Ship's wheel (examining captain's body yields COMPASS)
Two masts with tangled rigging (can climb with STRONG or AGILE body parts)
Hatch to below decks (barricaded from inside)
Rails where merpeople periodically emerge (combat: DROWNED SAILOR)

Faction Discovery:

Pounding on the hatch triggers dialogue: "Is that you, Redbeard's dogs? Or Silvereye's rats?"
Player must find a faction token to gain entry below decks

Two Paths (player chooses alliance):

Crow's Nest (requires climbing): Meet Silvereye's lookout, gain SILVEREYE'S PATCH after combat/puzzle
Captain's Cabin (use rusty key from Basement OR break down with STRONG parts): Find Redbeard's journal, gain REDBEARD'S COIN

Below Decks: Show faction token to gain entry. Contains:

Crew quarters (faction NPCs arguing)
Galley (COOKIE enemy - neutral, attacks everyone)
Cargo hold with treasure chest (locked - needs KEY from Academy)
Bilge with water rising (merpeople entering here)

Climax Options (based on faction):

Help Silvereye defend the crow's nest against MERMAID WITCH
Help Redbeard retake captain's cabin from DROWNED CAPTAIN (zombie captain)
Reject both, fight to the bilge and face LEVIATHAN HERALD (hardest, best rewards)

Exit: Winning grants safe passage to next dream via either ship's boat (sided with faction) or diving into whirlpool (rejected both)
Academy Sketch
Opening: Player arrives in a grand entrance hall during "Final Examination Day" - panicking students, echoing gongs, portraits with moving eyes.
Hub Hall: Central circular room with:

Four doors marked with symbols (Knowledge, Courage, Wisdom, Power)
Reception desk (BORED ADMINISTRATOR enemy if provoked)
Notice board: "All students must pass THREE examinations to graduate"
Central statue holding a KEY (magically sealed until 3 exams passed)

Exam Rooms (choose 3 of 4):
Knowledge - Library maze:

Navigate shifting bookshelf passages
Answer riddle from LIBRARIAN SHADE (fight if wrong)
Reward: THEOREM SCROLL (resonance generator)

Courage - Dueling hall:

Face HONOR STUDENT in combat
Optional: Accept handicap for better reward
Reward: DUELIST'S MARK (valor crests)

Wisdom - Professor's study:

Puzzle involving arranging mirrors and lenses
PROFESSOR'S ASSISTANT helps if you have Knowledge resonance
Reward: LENS OF TRUTH (reveals hidden things)

Power - Summoning chamber:

Defeat waves of SUMMONED IMPS
Each wave allows summoning your own ally with right components
Reward: BINDING CIRCLE (crest converter)

Secret: Finding the "Cheat Sheet" (hidden in library) allows bypassing one exam, but spawns HALL MONITOR enemy that pursues you between rooms.
Climax: After 3 exams, statue releases KEY. Using it opens the Headmaster's Tower, revealing the CORRUPTED DEAN - a multi-phase boss that tests all exam skills.
Exit: Dean's defeat opens a portal in his study's mirror (or use his teleportation circle if you found the ritual components).
Cross-Dream Connections
These designs create natural links:

Basement's rusty key opens Pirates captain's cabin
Pirates' treasure needs Academy KEY
Academy's Lens reveals Basement's pentacle's true nature
Silvereye's Patch might let you "see" through Academy illusions
Knowledge from Academy books might translate Basement's ritual circles

Each dream teaches different skills while maintaining its identity:

Basement: Cautious exploration, resource discovery
Pirates: Faction dynamics, vertical movement
Academy: Puzzle solving, optional challenges
RetryRLSo, something comes to mind - all these dreams-specific "actor types" - moving bookshelves, mirror puzzles, rising water, periodic spawns - seem like they might actually be easier to implement in GameMaker scenes/rooms than in the more "clean"/traditional Lua architecture we're considering. I probably just need some guidance on how to think about creating these various bespoke behaviors in the context of the Lua engine, where in GM they would simply be bespoke object instances, probably inheriting from some more generic "obj_actor".EditYou're absolutely right to flag this - GameMaker's object-oriented scene editor makes these one-off behaviors trivial, while Lua/Love2D requires more deliberate architecture. But the code-first approach actually gives you more control and cleaner patterns once you get the structure right.
Entity-Component Approach for Lua
Instead of GameMaker's inheritance tree, think in terms of entities with composable behaviors:
lua-- Entity base
Entity = {
    x = 0, y = 0,
    components = {}
}

-- Example: Rising Water
water = Entity:new(x, y)
water:addComponent(Renderer("water_tile"))
water:addComponent(Timer(2.0, function() 
    water.y = water.y - TILE_SIZE 
    checkPlayerDrowning()
end))
water:addComponent(Collision("water", {deadly = true}))

-- Example: Moving Bookshelf
bookshelf = Entity:new(x, y)
bookshelf:addComponent(Renderer("bookshelf"))
bookshelf:addComponent(PathMover({{x1,y1}, {x2,y2}}, speed))
bookshelf:addComponent(Collision("solid", {pushable = false}))
bookshelf:addComponent(Interactable("examine", "Ancient tomes line the shelves."))
Dream-Specific Behavior Systems
Each dream could have its own "director" that manages unique mechanics:
lua-- Pirates/PirateDirector.lua
PirateDirector = {
    water_level = DECK_HEIGHT,
    faction_state = "neutral",
    spawn_timer = 0
}

function PirateDirector:update(dt)
    -- Periodic merperson spawns
    self.spawn_timer = self.spawn_timer + dt
    if self.spawn_timer > SPAWN_INTERVAL then
        self:spawnMerperson()
        self.spawn_timer = 0
    end
    
    -- Rising water in bilge
    if self.current_room == "bilge" then
        self.water_level = self.water_level - WATER_RISE_RATE * dt
    end
end
Prefab Functions for Common Patterns
Create factory functions for common dream elements:
lua-- Academy/Prefabs.lua
function createMirrorPuzzle(x, y, solution_angle)
    local puzzle = Entity:new(x, y)
    puzzle:addComponent(Renderer("mirror"))
    puzzle:addComponent(Rotatable(45)) -- 45-degree increments
    puzzle:addComponent(StateMachine({
        idle = {sprite = "mirror"},
        solved = {sprite = "mirror_glow", on_enter = function()
            playSound("puzzle_solve")
            openDoor("wisdom_exit")
        end}
    }))
    puzzle:addComponent(Custom("check_solution", function(self)
        if self.rotation == solution_angle then
            self:setState("solved")
        end
    end))
    return puzzle
end

-- Usage in room setup
room.entities:add(createMirrorPuzzle(5, 7, 135))
Room Definition Pattern
Define rooms as data with behavior hooks:
lua-- Dreams/Academy/Rooms.lua
academy_rooms = {
    library = {
        width = 20, height = 15,
        tilemap = "library_tiles.lua",
        
        on_enter = function(room)
            room:spawnEntity("moving_bookshelf", 10, 5)
            room:spawnEntity("librarian_shade", 15, 10)
            if player:hasItem("cheat_sheet") then
                room:spawnEntity("hall_monitor", 1, 1)
            end
        end,
        
        on_update = function(room, dt)
            -- Shift bookshelf maze every 10 seconds
            room.maze_timer = (room.maze_timer or 0) + dt
            if room.maze_timer > 10 then
                room:shuffleBookshelfPositions()
                room.maze_timer = 0
            end
        end
    }
}
State Machines for Complex Actors
For intricate behaviors, use state machines:
lua-- Pirates/BelowDecks.lua
factionNPC = Entity:new(x, y)
factionNPC:addComponent(StateMachine({
    neutral = {
        on_interact = function(self)
            showDialogue("Who are you with, stranger?")
            showChoices({"Redbeard", "Silvereye", "Neither"})
        end
    },
    allied = {
        on_interact = function(self)
            showDialogue("Good to have you with us!")
            giveHint("The merpeople fear the deep...")
        end
    },
    hostile = {
        on_enter = function(self)
            self:addComponent(CombatAI("aggressive"))
        end
    }
}))
Advantages Over GameMaker
This approach actually gives you some benefits:

Version control: Everything is code, merges/diffs are clean
Procedural generation: Easy to spawn variants of prefabs
Debugging: Can log/inspect everything, hot-reload components
Modding: Players can write new behaviors in Lua
Testing: Can unit test behaviors in isolation

Practical Migration Strategy
Start with a simple actor system and extend as needed:
lua-- Core/Actor.lua
Actor = {}
Actor.__index = Actor

function Actor:new(x, y, type)
    local a = {
        x = x, y = y,
        type = type,
        update = nil,  -- Optional custom update
        draw = nil,    -- Optional custom draw
        interact = nil -- Optional interaction
    }
    
    -- Load type-specific behaviors
    if ActorTypes[type] then
        for k,v in pairs(ActorTypes[type]) do
            a[k] = v
        end
    end
    
    return setmetatable(a, Actor)
end

-- Dreams/Basement/Actors.lua
ActorTypes.wall_crack = {
    sprite = "crack",
    interact = function(self, player)
        if player:hasEquipped("shovel") then
            self:destroy()
            spawnEnemy("zombie", self.x, self.y)
        else
            showMessage("The crack is too narrow...")
        end
    end
}
The key insight: GameMaker's visual object system is just creating data structures with behaviors attached. In Lua, you're doing the same thing, just explicitly in code. Once you have your base patterns established (Entity, Component, StateMachine, Director), adding new dream-specific behaviors becomes just as quick as in GameMaker, with better maintainability.RetryRLOK, maybe we're ready to break ground on this one. Can you help me plan out the initial steps in Lua/LOVE?EditAbsolutely! Let's start with a minimal but solid foundation. We'll build just enough to validate the architecture while keeping momentum.

Step 2: Basic Overworld State (Week 1-2)
lua-- states/overworld.lua
local Overworld = {}
local Player = require("systems.player")
local TileMap = require("systems.tilemap")

function Overworld:enter()
    self.player = Player:new(5, 5)  -- Tile coordinates

    self.map:draw()
    self.player:draw()
end

Step 3: Tile System (Week 1-2)
lua-- systems/tilemap.lua
local TileMap = {}
TileMap.__index = TileMap

local TILE_SIZE = 32

function TileMap:new(room_file)
    local room_data = require(room_file)

end

function TileMap:getTile(x, y)
    if x < 1 or x > self.width or y < 1 or y > self.height then
        return 1  -- Solid

    return self.tiles[y] and self.tiles[y][x] or 0
end

function TileMap:isSolid(x, y)
    local tile = self:getTile(x, y)
    return tile == 1  -- 1 = wall, 0 = floor
end

    for y = 1, self.height do
        for x = 1, self.width do
            local tile = self.tiles[y][x]
            if tile == 1 then
                love.graphics.setColor(0.4, 0.3, 0.3)  -- Wall
            else
                love.graphics.setColor(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)  -- Floor

                (x-1) * TILE_SIZE, 
                (y-1) * TILE_SIZE, 
                TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE)
        end

end

return TileMap
Step 4: Player Controller (Week 2)
lua-- systems/player.lua
local Player = {}
Player.__index = Player

function Player:new(x, y)
    return setmetatable({
        x = x,
        y = y,

        move_delay = 0.15  -- Seconds between moves
    }, Player)
end

function Player:update(dt, map)
    self.move_timer = math.max(0, self.move_timer - dt)
end

function Player:keypressed(key, map)
    if self.move_timer > 0 then return end
    
    local dx, dy = 0, 0
    if key == "up" then dy = -1
    elseif key == "down" then dy = 1
    elseif key == "left" then dx = -1
    elseif key == "right" then dx = 1
    else return end
    
    local new_x, new_y = self.x + dx, self.y + dy
    
    if not map:isSolid(new_x, new_y) then
        self.x = new_x
        self.y = new_y
        self.move_timer = self.move_delay
    end
end

function Player:draw()
    love.graphics.setColor(0.7, 0.7, 1)  -- Player color
    love.graphics.rectangle("fill",
        (self.x - 1) * 32 + 8,
        (self.y - 1) * 32 + 8,
        16, 16)
    love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1)
end

Step 5: First Room Data (Week 2)
lua-- data/rooms/basement_1.lua
return {
    width = 10,
    height = 8,
    tiles = {
        {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
        {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}
    },
    entities = {
        {type = "crack", x = 2, y = 1},
        {type = "crack", x = 9, y = 4},
        {type = "crack", x = 5, y = 7},
        {type = "pipe", x = 3, y = 1, has_shovel = true}
    }
}
Next Milestones
Week 3-4: Interactions

Add entity system with interaction handling
Implement inventory (shovel pickup/equip)
Wall crack digging mechanic

Week 5-6: Combat Transition

Trigger combat from entity interaction
Basic combat state with placeholder UI
Return to overworld after combat

Week 7-8: Combat Core

Body part system
Tech selection and dice rolls
Basic enemy AI

Development Tips

Start with colored rectangles - Don't worry about sprites yet
Use love.keypressed initially - Add smooth movement later
Print debug info - Show player coords, current room, etc.
Hot reload during dev:

luafunction love.keypressed(key)
    if key == "f5" then
        love.event.quit("restart")  -- Restart the game
    end
end

Version control from day 1 - Commit after each working feature

This foundation gives you a working game loop in week 1-2, then you can iteratively add complexity. The key is maintaining a playable build at all times - even if it's just moving a square around a room, that's infinitely more motivating than a non-running pile of systems.
Ready to start coding? The first milestone is just getting that player square moving around the Basement!
